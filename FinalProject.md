# Swift vs. Python

### Swift

### Python

## Language Purpose/ Genesis

### Swift

### Python 

Python is a high level programming language for general use programming. Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. Python has a philosophy to emphasize code readability. Python uses white spaces and code blocks rather than keywords and curly braces. This results in fewer lines of code. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale. 

## Unique Features

### Python

Python uses white spaces and code blocks rather than keywords and curly braces. Whitespace is used to denote blocks. In other languages curly braces are common. When you indent it becomes a child of the previous line. In addition to the indentation, the parent also has a colon following it. A line does not end with a semicolon ,which results in fewer lines of code.  Python does have many other unique features to it like the interactive interpreter, descriptors, yield, and the use of generators and coroutines. 



```javascript
something{ 
    something1 
    something2 
} something3
```

```python
Something 
   something1 
   something2 
Something3`
```

## Name Spaces

### Swift

### Python 

Python implements most namespaces. Namespaces in python have had many lifetimes because they are created at different times. The namespace containing Pythonâ€™s built in names is created when the interpreter starts up. Namespaces read from a script file are called _main_ and have their own global namespace. 



## Types

### Swift

### Python 

The type system in Python is dynamic. Which means you do not need to declare a type when you are declaring a variable. Python supports,  booleans, integers, longs, floats, complex numbers, strings, bytes, byte arrays, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Numeric types, strings, tuples and sets are immutable. 


## Classes

### Swift

### Python 

Declaring a class in python is very simple and python does not have access modifiers. 

```python
class SampleClass     
```

To instantiate a class. 

```python
x = SampleClass()     
```

In python there are no access modifiers. To construct an object with arguments you have to define an _init_ method in the class.

```python
Class SampleClass
	Def __init__ (self, var1, var2)
		Self.var1 = var1

		Self.var2 = var2
```
    



```python
x = SampleClass('foo',18)
```
