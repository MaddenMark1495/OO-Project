## Language Purpose/ Genesis

### Swift

### Python 

Python is a high level programming language for general use programming. Python was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1991. Python has a philosophy to emphasize code readability. Python uses white spaces and code blocks rather than keywords and curly braces. This results in fewer lines of code. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale. 

## Unique Features

### Python

Python uses white spaces and code blocks rather than keywords and curly braces. Whitespace is used to denote blocks. In other languages curly braces are common. When you indent it becomes a child of the previous line. In addition to the indentation, the parent also has a colon following it. A line does not end with a semicolon ,which results in fewer lines of code.  Python does have many other unique features to it like the interactive interpreter, descriptors, yield, and the use of generators and coroutines. 



```javascript
something
 { \something1 
 
    something2 
} something3
```

```python
Something 
   something1 
   something2 
Something3`
```
